![image](https://i.gyazo.com/3a23938f0f8f97bdd0943af2fd732694.png)

This site is a submission which was to be graded as the last task for the second semester. In this task, I was to make a blog-page, with the topic of my choice. No content was provided. After deciding what our content was, we were to add all our content to wordpress rest-API and display it on our site with API-calls. 

## Description
- I chose my favorite dog-breeds as my topic, and the target audience was anyone who likes dogs. 
- The purpose of the website is to share my own personal bias to what i consider the best breeds of dog. Each blog post contains a title, an image and a description.  
- The task specifies the need for a contact page with regular expressions validating for each of the input fields with javascript, an about page, 15 blog posts, an "all blogs" page and a home page.
- The website is meant to be a subjective opinion, and aims to make that obvious.
